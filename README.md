# Perfect Pose Workout Tracker

A computer vision-based workout tracking application that counts repetitions and calculates calories burned during various exercises.

## Calorie Calculation Approach

The application uses the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) method for calculating calories burned, which is a scientifically accepted approach for estimating energy expenditure during physical activities.

### How It Works

1. **MET Values**: Each workout type is assigned a specific MET value:
   - Push-ups: 8.0 MET
   - Squats: 5.0 MET
   - Jumping Jacks: 8.0 MET
   - Lunges: 6.0 MET
   - Planks: 4.0 MET
   - Burpees: 8.0 MET

2. **Calculation Formula**:
   ```
   Calories = MET × Weight(kg) × Duration(hours)
   ```

3. **Real-time Updates**: The application calculates calories burned incrementally by:
   - Measuring the time elapsed since the last update
   - Converting that duration to hours
   - Applying the formula with the appropriate MET value for the workout type
   - Adding the result to the running total of calories burned

### Strengths of This Approach

- **Scientific Basis**: The MET method is widely used in exercise science and provides a reasonable estimate of energy expenditure.
- **Personalization**: It accounts for the user's weight, which is a key factor in calorie expenditure.
- **Workout Specificity**: Different exercises have different MET values, reflecting their varying intensities.
- **Real-time Updates**: Calories are calculated incrementally as the workout progresses.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Individual Variation**: The standard MET values don't account for individual fitness levels. A beginner will burn more calories doing push-ups than someone who is very fit.

2. **Intensity Consideration**: The current implementation doesn't account for the intensity of the exercise. For example, fast push-ups burn more calories than slow ones.

3. **Heart Rate Integration**: Incorporating heart rate data would provide a more accurate estimate of calorie expenditure, as it reflects actual physiological effort.

4. **Rest Periods**: The current calculation doesn't differentiate between active exercise and rest periods during the workout.

5. **Form Quality**: While the application tracks reps, it could adjust calorie calculations based on the quality of form.

6. **User Characteristics**: While weight is considered, other factors like age, gender, and fitness level could be incorporated for more accurate estimates.

## Features

- Real-time repetition counting for various exercises
- Calorie burn estimation based on MET values
- Workout statistics tracking
- Integration with health APIs for data storage

## Usage

1. Select a workout type from the menu
2. Position yourself in front of the camera
3. Perform the exercise while the application tracks your movements
4. Press 'q' to end the workout and view your summary statistics

## Future Development Roadmap

### Form Quality Assessment with CNN-LSTM Model

To enhance the accuracy of workout tracking and provide better feedback to users, we plan to implement a CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory) model for exercise form assessment:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Record videos of correct and incorrect exercise forms
   - Label frames with form quality scores
   - Create a diverse dataset covering different body types and exercise variations

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - CNN component to extract spatial features from each video frame
   - LSTM component to analyze the temporal sequence of movements
   - Output layer to provide a form quality score (0-100%)

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Train the model on the collected dataset
   - Integrate the model with the existing pose detection system
   - Provide real-time feedback on form quality
   - Adjust calorie calculations based on form quality (better form = more efficient calorie burn)

4. **Benefits**:
   - More accurate rep counting by distinguishing proper from improper movements
   - Personalized form correction feedback
   - Injury prevention through proper form guidance
   - More precise calorie calculations

### Apple Watch & Apple Health Integration

To further enhance the accuracy of calorie calculations and provide a more comprehensive fitness tracking experience:

1. **Apple Watch Data Collection**:
   - Heart rate monitoring during workouts
   - Movement and acceleration data
   - Stand/activity metrics

2. **Apple Health API Integration**:
   - Store workout data in Apple Health
   - Access historical workout data
   - Retrieve user metrics (age, height, weight, etc.)
   - Track progress over time

3. **Enhanced Calorie Calculation**:
   - Use heart rate data to calculate calories using the heart rate method:
     ```
     Calories = [(Heart Rate × 0.4472) - (Age × 0.05741) + (Weight × 0.1263) + Gender Factor - 20.4022] × Time / 4.184
     ```
   - Create a hybrid model combining MET values and heart rate data
   - Account for individual fitness levels based on historical data

4. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Use HealthKit framework for iOS integration
   - Develop a companion iOS app for Apple Watch communication
   - Implement secure data transfer between devices
   - Create a unified dashboard showing combined metrics

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Workout recommendations based on historical performance
   - Recovery time suggestions based on workout intensity
   - Weekly and monthly fitness reports
   - Social sharing and competition features

By implementing these enhancements, Perfect Pose will evolve from a simple workout tracker to a comprehensive fitness platform that provides personalized guidance, accurate metrics, and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem. # perfect-pose-vision-demo
